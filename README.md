# Order of Operations

As of right now I am still working on the CMS locally on my computer using [Laravel Homestead.] (https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/homestead)

The files on this repository are only HTML & SASS. No CraftCMS files are on here yet. I'll explain why â€”

What is LIVE on the actual website right now is just pure HTML & SASS to mock up the site.
I've decided not to upload the MYSQL database and CMS until it's all structured and tested on my machine to avoid problems LIVE.

The Calendar and Firmly Rooted Newsletter is going to be the hardest part of this site.
We will be using [Solspace Calendar] (https://solspace.com/craft/calendar) plugin for CraftCMS.

The News page and rest of the site is going to be powered by CraftCMS alone.

If you're wondering why I'm using Craft instead of other CMS systems you can look up why or check out this article.

# Localization

As for localization, [Craft has their own method/feature] (https://craftcms.com/docs/localization-guide) although it does cost $200 and we have to ask the board for budgets.

Haru if you can figure out a how to do the localization without paying for the feature I'm all ears.
